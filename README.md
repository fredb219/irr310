Irr310
======

Originally, Irr310 aim to be a physic and programing based persistent mutiplayer game. But to have a hope to have a playable game before the end of times, Irr310 is now a space opera shooter game. The game still have a mutiplayer mode and the physic still have an importance but there is no more craft or programming ... for once.

In Irr310, the player control an AI send in a strange parralele universe to defence an unknown structure: the Monolith.
